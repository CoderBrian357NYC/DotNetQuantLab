### StochRSIBot [StochRSIBot](https://github.com/CoderBrian357NYC/StochRSIBot) 

A long-only cryptocurrency trading bot using the Stochastic RSI indicator with ATR-based position sizing. 
Designed to maintain only one open trade at a time.

Configuration

Equity: Initial capital for trading.
atrMultiplier: Controls the position size relative to market volatility.
MaxOpenTrades: Should be set to 1 to ensure only one trade is open at a time.
StochRSI parameters such as the RSI period, Stochastic period, and smoothing factors.
Trading pair and time intervals.
How It Works

The bot fetches live price data from Binance.
It calculates the Stochastic RSI indicator.
When the StochRSI signals an oversold condition, the bot attempts to open a long position.
The bot uses the ATR to size the position, adjusting for market volatility.
Only one position is allowed open at any time; new entries are skipped if a trade is already open.
Positions are closed based on exit conditions defined in the strategy.
Future Enhancements

Add short selling capability.
Implement trailing stops and dynamic exits.
Improve logging and monitoring features.
Add backtesting capabilities.
